2. **Reference Tasks Clearly**: When updating or completing tasks, be specific
   - Good: "Complete the grocery shopping task"
   - Better: "Mark task #3 as completed" (if you know the task number)

3. **Group Related Tasks**: Consider organizing similar activities
   - "Add tasks: call dentist, schedule appointment, confirm availability"

### Conversation Tips
1. **Maintain Context**: The bot remembers conversation context within the same conversation
2. **Correct Mistakes**: If the bot misunderstands, clarify: "No, I meant..."
3. **Be Patient**: Allow time for tool execution, indicated by tool status messages
