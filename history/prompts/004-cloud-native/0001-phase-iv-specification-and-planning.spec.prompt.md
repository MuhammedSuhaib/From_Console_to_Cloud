## Phase IV Specification and Planning - Cloud Native Todo Chatbot

### Summary
Created comprehensive specification, plan, and tasks for Phase IV: Cloud Native Todo Chatbot deployment on Kubernetes using AI-assisted DevOps tools (Docker AI, kubectl-ai, Kagent).

### Technical Details

#### Constitution Update
- Updated project constitution with detailed Phase IV requirements
- Added specific details about containerization, orchestration, and AI-assisted tool usage
- Defined technology stack including Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, and AI DevOps tools

#### Specification Creation
- Created comprehensive spec outlining objectives, requirements, and architecture
- Defined containerization requirements using Docker and Docker AI Agent (Gordon)
- Specified Kubernetes deployment on Minikube with Helm Charts
- Included AI-assisted DevOps tool requirements (kubectl-ai, Kagent)

#### Planning
- Developed detailed implementation plan with architecture decisions
- Identified key decisions around containerization strategy and deployment architecture
- Planned phased approach: containerization → Kubernetes setup → Helm charts → deployment → optimization

#### Task Breakdown
- Created granular tasks organized by phases (containerization, Kubernetes setup, Helm charts, deployment, optimization)
- Included specific tasks for AI tool utilization
- Defined success criteria and risk mitigation strategies

#### Implementation Foundation
- Created implementation completion summary document
- Updated docker-compose.yml with correct paths for monorepo structure (full-stack-todo instead of frontend)
- Prepared foundation for AI-assisted deployment workflow

### Key Features
- Complete Phase IV specification and planning artifacts
- AI-assisted DevOps tool integration
- Proper monorepo structure recognition
- Detailed task breakdown for systematic implementation
- Foundation for Agentic Dev Stack workflow

### Implementation Notes
- All artifacts follow the Agentic Dev Stack workflow (Spec → Plan → Tasks → Implement)
- Docker AI Agent (Gordon), kubectl-ai, and Kagent are integrated into the plan
- Proper attention to monorepo structure with full-stack-todo directory
- Kubernetes deployment planned for Minikube with Helm Charts
- Cloud-native best practices incorporated throughout
