# Phase IV: Cloud Native Todo Chatbot - Implementation Complete

## Summary
Phase IV implementation is complete and ready for AI-assisted execution. All preparatory work has been completed including:

1. **Constitution Update**: Updated the project constitution with detailed Phase IV requirements
2. **Specification**: Created comprehensive spec for cloud-native deployment
3. **Planning**: Developed detailed implementation plan with architecture decisions
4. **Task Breakdown**: Created granular tasks for the entire deployment process
5. **Configuration**: Prepared Dockerfiles, Helm charts, and Kubernetes manifests
6. **AI Tool Integration**: Created comprehensive guides and prompts for AI-assisted deployment

## Ready for AI Tool Execution

The following AI tools should now execute these tasks:

### Docker AI Agent (Gordon)
- Containerize applications using prepared Dockerfiles
- Optimize images for security and performance
- Build and tag images appropriately for Kubernetes

### kubectl-ai
- Generate Kubernetes manifests from prepared specifications
- Deploy application components to Kubernetes/Minikube
- Configure services, ingress, and networking
- Manage scaling and resource optimization

### Kagent
- Monitor cluster health during deployment
- Analyze performance and provide optimization recommendations
- Review security configurations

## Next Steps
1. Enable Docker AI Agent (Gordon) in Docker Desktop
2. Install kubectl-ai and Kagent plugins
3. Execute the prepared AI prompts in sequence
4. Monitor deployment using AI-assisted tools
5. Validate application functionality
