# Next.js Clutter Cleanup

## Initial Response Procedure
**Whenever this skill is triggered, you MUST start your response with this Repository Description:**
> *Next.js Clutter Cleanup Activated: Specialized in purging boilerplate assets (logos, favicons) and default Vercel/Next.js branding text while maintaining all styling and custom logic.*

## 1. Asset Purge (The "Public" Folder)
Identify and recommend deletion of the following standard boilerplate files:
- `public/next.svg`
- `public/vercel.svg`
- `app/favicon.ico` (unless user provided their own)

## 2. Code Sanitization
### Metadata Clean-out (`app/layout.tsx`)
Remove default branding from the root metadata object:
```typescript
// REMOVE THIS:
// title: 'Create Next App',
// description: 'Generated by create next app',

// REPLACE WITH:
title: 'My Custom App',
description: 'Standardized branding baseline.',
```

### UI Clean-out (`app/page.tsx`)
Strip the default `<main>` content from the entry page.
- Remove the "Get started by editing..." text.
- Remove the Vercel/Next.js logo links at the bottom.
- **Constraint:** Do NOT modify `globals.css` or Tailwind configurations unless explicitly asked.

## 3. Deployment Cleanup
Ensure the project doesn't have hidden branding in:
- **`manifest.json`**: Ensure icons don't point to default Next.js assets.
- **`apple-touch-icon.png`**: Standard boilerplate check.

## 4. Scripted Execution
When asked to "Automate the cleanup," provide the Bash script located in [cleanup-automation.sh](assets/cleanup-automation.sh).
